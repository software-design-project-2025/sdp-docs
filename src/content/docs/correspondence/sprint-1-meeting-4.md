- Follow-up: The previous meeting confirmed steady development progress and clarified rubric requirements. This meeting centered on Sprint 1 review and planning for Sprint 2.
- The team met with the client to assess progress on the first sprint.
- The client was only partially satisfied:
    - A significant portion of the documentation was missing.
    - Implementation contained flaws and some prohibited shortcuts were used.
    - Despite these issues, the client acknowledged that the progress made was fair considering the timeframe.
    - The client provided advice and outlined expectations for Sprint 2, with emphasis on:
    - Improving implementation quality.
    - Completing and refining documentation.
    - Strengthening testing practices.

###### Decisions/Agreements:
- Documentation must be substantially improved in Sprint 2.
- Prohibited shortcuts must be removed; implementation quality should follow best practices.
- Testing is to be expanded and properly documented.

###### Action Items:
- Address documentation gaps before/during Sprint 2.
- Refactor implementation to remove shortcuts and resolve flaws.
- Establish stronger testing procedures for Sprint 2.

###### Next Meeting:
